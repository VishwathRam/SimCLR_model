# SimCLR_model
 SimCLR is a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations.  It learns representations by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data example via a contrastive loss in the latent space.
 This model was written in tensorflow in a colab notebook.
 The model was trained with a colorectal cancer histology dataset. Each example is a 150 x 150 x 3 RGB image of one of 8 classes.
